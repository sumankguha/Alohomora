## Overview

A **typical** use case is: 
- generate a dataframe for raw variables
	- Session-wide
		- Total infusions
		- Total active lever
		- Total inactive lever
		- Preference score
		- Ratio = active / infusions
		- active lever interactions during infusion and time-out periods
		- Cumulative infusions
		- Cumulative active lever
	- Hour-wise per session
		- 1-h binned infusions
		- 1-h binned active lever
		- 1-h binned inactive lever
		- 1-h binned ratio
		- 1-h binned active lever interactions during infusion and time-out periods
		- 1-h binned cumulative infusions
		- 1-h binned active lever 
	- First hour data
		- First hour infusions
		- First hour active lever
		- First hour inactive lever
		- First hour ratio
		- First hour active lever interactions during infusion and time-out periods
		- First hour cumulative infusions
		- First hour cumulative active lever
	- Minute-wise first hour per session
		- 10-min binned infusions
		- 10-min binned active lever
		- 10-min binned inactive lever
		- 10-min binned ratio
		- 10-min binned active lever interactions during infusions and time-out periods
		- 10-min binned cumulative infusions
		- 10-min binned cumulative active lever
